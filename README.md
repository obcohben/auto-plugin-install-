<p>
this will show you have to install autoplugin on your jail broken ps vita. all rights go to theheroGAC the guy that made autoplugin so plase go and check he out on github now let get on with it. 
</p>


<br>

## what will you need:
   * a ps vita what is jail broken and have vita shell on it on it if you don't have that go and check out my orther repo that show you  
    how to do that - https://github.com/obcohben/ps-vita-jail-break
    <br> 
   * a cable to connect your vita to your p
     and a windows pc - i not sure if this will work on mac or linux. 
<br>
frist you need to download the auto plugin vpk the i will put a like to the git hub page to auto pluging. 
</br>

## software you need:

     auto plugin - https://github.com/theheroGAC/Autoplugin/releases
<br>
you can also just clone or downdownload it from my github repo as well.  - ' git commit https://github.com/obcohben/auto-plugin-install-.git '

<br>

<p>
<br>
you need to click on the then link then click one that say Autoplugin.vpk and it will stat the download 
</p>

<br>

<p>
 once you have downloaded that you need to go your ps vita and open vita shell (rember you need you run h-encore and click the frist one down to start the jail break if your jail break kis not permanently install). when you are in vitashell press the select button on your ps vita to connect it to your pc. 
</P>

<br>

<p>
 now you have done that and your vita is showing up on your pc as a hard drive all you need to is drag that <b>autoplugin.vpk</b> file onto your vita and your now done with your pc but don't unplug your vita yet. 
</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 now go back to your vita and and press the circle button on your ps vita then go to the file called ux0 then go all the way down to the button till you see the autoplugin.vpk. press x on it then it should start installing to your vita. you may have to press x a few times if it ask you anything don't worry it all safe. 
</p>

<br>
 and now all you need to do is it exit out of vita shell and auto plugin should be installed and dancing on your home screen :). 
<br>
 
 <p>
